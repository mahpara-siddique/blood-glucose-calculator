# Blood Glucose and HbA1c Assessment App

This Streamlit app allows users to assess their blood glucose levels, receive health advice, and calculate an estimated HbA1c based on user inputs. It is designed to help users better understand their blood sugar control and take steps to maintain their health.

## Features

1. **Blood Glucose Level Assessment**:
   - Input fasting or post-meal glucose levels.
   - Receive tailored health advice based on the entered glucose level.

2. **HbA1c Estimation**:
   - Input your average glucose level to calculate your estimated HbA1c value using the formula:
     \[
     \text{HbA1c} = \frac{\text{Average Glucose (mg/dL)} + 46.7}{28.7}
     \]

3. **Interactive and Easy to Use**:
   - Simple and clean interface using Streamlit widgets.
